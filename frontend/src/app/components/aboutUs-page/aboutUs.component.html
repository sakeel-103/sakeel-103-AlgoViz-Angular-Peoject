        <h1>About Our Project</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome to our Graph Traversal Project! This project focuses on
          implementing Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS)
          algorithms for graph traversal. These algorithms play a crucial role
          in various applications like pathfinding, network analysis, and AI
          search strategies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our backend features user authentication functionality, providing a
          Login and Signup page for a secure and personalized experience.
          Whether you are a student learning graph theory or a professional
          looking to understand advanced search algorithms, our platform offers
          a comprehensive solution for understanding these traversal techniques.
