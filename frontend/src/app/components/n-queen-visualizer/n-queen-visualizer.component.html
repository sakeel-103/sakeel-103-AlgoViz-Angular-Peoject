      The objective of the N-Queens problem is to place N queens on an N x N
      chessboard so that no two queens can attack each other. This means that no
      two queens can share the same row, column, or diagonal. The problem has
      been around since the 19th century and has fascinated mathematicians,
      computer scientists, and puzzle enthusiasts for decades. The problem is
      considered a classic example of a problem that can be solved using
      recursion and backtracking. You can formulate the problem recursively by:
      <br /><br />
      1. Simplifying the problem to the most trivial case<br />
      2. Generating all possible permutations of the queens' positions<br />
      3. Checking if each permutation is a valid placement.
